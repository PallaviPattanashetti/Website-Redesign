 // Exercise or Lab name- Website Redesign

// Person who Peer Reviewed your assignment-Lucas Guptill: website looks really good and i like the color/fonts used in the design, mobile responsiveness is really good for the most part and i could only spot an image or 2 that didnt adjust correctly but seeing that mine likes to tweak out a good bit i took that as a browser issue on my behalf (little odd bit was the pendulum picture on mobile inventory page)

use of colors fonts and design for your website makes it feel very warm and on theme with everything. Amazing work everyone 10/10 redeseign.
